Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological brain disorder, which damages the brain cells, and eventually a 
patient loses the ability to carry out simple day to day tasks. According to an estimate, about 5.3 million 
Americans are suffering from AD in 2015. This number is likely to go as high as 16 million by 2050. The cause
of AD is inadequately understood and still no proper treatment has been discovered to stop the progression of 
this disease. An early diagnosis of AD can help in determining its progression and also improve the quality of 
life of AD patients. Recently, the analysis of neuro-imaging data has drawn attention because it helps
in early and accurate detection of AD. The prodromal stage of AD is known as the mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
which has a 10% conversion rate to AD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used in studies related to 
AD due to its exceptional spatial resolution, high accessibility, and good contrast. 


Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, which results in memory related issues in subjects. 
An accurate detection and classification of AD alongside its prodromal stage i.e., mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) is of great clinical importance. In this Project Alzheimer classification algorithm is presented. The 
proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in key evaluation parameters including accuracy, 
sensitivity, and specificity. An accuracy of 99% is achieved for 4 Class classification of AD.
